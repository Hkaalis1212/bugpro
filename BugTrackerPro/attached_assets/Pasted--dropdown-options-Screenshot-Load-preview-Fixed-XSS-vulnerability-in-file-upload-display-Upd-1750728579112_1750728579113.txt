‚úì Fixed XSS vulnerability in file upload display
‚úì Updated team creation to require project selection
‚úì Improved dropdown functionality with error handling
‚úì Enhanced project-team assignment workflow

I've fixed the project and team assignment functionality. The dropdowns now properly cascade - you select a project first, then available teams for that project appear, followed by team members. Teams must now be created under specific projects. Can you test the project and team assignment workflow to see if it's working as expected?

I see you want to add a simplified home route with a clean form. I'll add this route to the existing Flask application while maintaining the current functionality.

Dark theme has been fully restored.
